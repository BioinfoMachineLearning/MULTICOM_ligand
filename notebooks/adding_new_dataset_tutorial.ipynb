    "`MULTICOM_ligand` encompasses several datasets for benchmarking protein-ligand structure prediction methods. However, you may want to add your own dataset to `MULTICOM_ligand` to fulfill a specific use case or to test a specific idea. This tutorial will show you how to do so for a new collection of *single*-ligand protein complexes. For help integrating a new *multi*-ligand protein complex dataset, please create a new GitHub issue or send us an email. We would be happy to help you add this new collection to the benchmark!\n",
    "\n",
    "To add your custom *single*-ligand dataset to `MULTICOM_ligand`, you just have to follow the following 4-step procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new directory under `data/` with the required suffix `_set` (e.g., `data/newest_set/`) and group your (ground-truth) data files by unique IDs within this new directory (e.g., `data/newest_set/1G9V_RQ4/1G9V_RQ4_{protein.pdb,ligand.sdf}`)\n",
    "2. Update the config files throughout `configs/analysis/`, `configs/data/`, and `configs/model/` to list your new dataset as a CLI argument (e.g., `dataset: newest`)\n",
    "3. Predict `apo` protein structures for your new dataset using ESMFold by integrating parsing for your dataset into the ESMFold-related source code within `multicom_ligand/data/ligand/data/components/esmfold_fasta_preparation.py` and `multicom_ligand/data/components/esmfold_apo_to_holo_alignment.py`\n",
    "4. Using `notebooks/posebusters_astex_inference_results_plotting.ipynb` as a template, add a new Jupyter notebook to `notebooks/` for plotting each method's results on your new dataset (after preparing each method's dataset inputs and running inference with each desired method)"
